# PDF Label Cropper & Watcher

A small Python script that automatically **watches a folder for new PDF shipping labels**, crops them to a fixed region (e.g. 190x100 mm labels), and saves the processed result in a `processed/` subfolder.  

Useful for automatically converting full-page courier labels into smaller ones ready for thermal printers.

- Monitors a folder for new `.pdf` files.
- Crops each page of the PDF to a configurable region.
- Saves the cropped result in a `processed/` subfolder.

Yes, this was written with the help of ChatGPT, I'm sorry.

You need these python libraries installed:
- watchdog
- pymupdf
- pillow

The easiest way to use it is to run it from console with python "PDF-Cropper.py", but you can also use something like pyinstaller to bundle it into a .exe.
